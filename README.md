Hi my name is Ido Avnir, I am From Tel Aviv, Israel. My project's name Is "Helping Hand", its purpose is to help people that can't go out to buy groceries, medicine, or other necessities because of the corona virus. We help people by connecting them to volunteers who are willing to help people near their locations during these days. The program has two main features:

1. Fill in a form for help, in which people enter their name, phone number, city, area of living (only in Israel), and the type of help that they need(food/med/other).
2. Interface for volunteers, in which people can create an account, and then see a table of people that need help, first showing people in their city and then showing people from other cities in their area, all ordered by date. After helping someone, people can report the finished request in order to remove it from the pending requests table. Every volunteer can also see a history of all the people that he helped to.

Some features of my website:

1. Login-logout using session.
2. Interactive navigation bar with bootstrap, which changes with regard to the specific page.
3. Two databases, one for volunteers and one for requests.
4. Input checks in every input needed.
5. Password check - password must consist both letters and numbers and be at least 6 letters long.
6. Main layout which most of the pages exntend from.
7. Loops and conditions inside the HTML files.
8. Eleven templates.

I hoped you liked my project, thank you and stay safe.

Ido
